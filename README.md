### Challenges

- The biggest one was an image slider since it was fully custom and there were a lots of problems with responsivity and swiping
- Getting used to Typescript and static typing
- Testing - writing useful tests (It would be much better if TDD method was used - First writing a test,then writing minimal code to pass that test)

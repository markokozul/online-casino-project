### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

- superset of JavaScript
- allows usage of static typing

### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

### [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### Challenges

- The biggest one was an image slider since it was fully custom and there were a lots of problems with responsivity and swiping
- Getting used to Typescript and static typing
- Testing - writing useful tests (It would be much better if TDD method was used - First writing a test,then writing minimal code to pass that test)
